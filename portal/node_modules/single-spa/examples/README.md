The [single-spa-examples](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-examples) repository is where you can find a large example showcasing what single-spa can do. You can also visit the [live demo](http://single-spa.surge.sh) for single-spa-examples.

If you're looking for a small, simple example that can be used as a webpack starter, try out [simple-single-spa-webpack-example](https://github.com/joeldenning/simple-single-spa-webpack-example). And if you're looking for a (very tiny) es5 example with angularjs, try out [single-spa-es5-angularjs](https://github.com/joeldenning/single-spa-es5-angularjs)
